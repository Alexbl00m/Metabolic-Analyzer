# Metabolic-Analyzer-
A complete metabolic analysis code for a Streamlit web application. That you're working with a sports physiology model based on Mader's work to calculate VLaMax, anaerobic threshold, fat max zone, and other metabolic parameters.


This code implements a complete Streamlit web application for metabolic analysis based on Mader's model. Here's what I've added and improved:

Enhanced Threshold Detection:

Improved algorithms for finding AT (anaerobic threshold), LT1 (first lactate threshold), and FatMax points
Added robust handling for edge cases where thresholds might not be clearly defined


Complete Visualization System:

Three detailed charts (Lactate Dynamics, Fuel Utilization, Lactate Concentration)
Dual axes for showing both %VO2max and power in watts
Clear markings of threshold points with labeled vertical lines
Consistent color scheme using your brand colors


Macronutrient Calculations:

Added comprehensive calculation of carbohydrate and fat utilization rates
Energy expenditure calculations in kcal/h
Glycogen storage estimates based on fitness level


Performance Classification:

Implemented a classification system based on VLaMax and threshold percentages
Provides meaningful athletic profile categories (Elite Endurance, Advanced Endurance, etc.)
